# Encyclopedia of 4D-3D-2D images analysis
Welcome to the encyclopedia of helper scripts for handling, processing and analysing 2D, 3D and 4D images. The repository is under construction. Feel free to send me an email at antoine_ruzette AT hms harvard edu if you wish to contribute. 

## ðŸ’¡ Background

The idea of this repository is to facilitate sharing the gigantic amount of amazing scripts developed by researchers over the years, that would probably never be used by another researchers. The field of bioimage analysis is characterized by simple yet time-consuming tasks when it comes to handle and analyse data. Let's, together, share our best scripts to facilitate each other's lives. Viva open source!
